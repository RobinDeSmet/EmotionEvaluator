FINDINGS
  - Applying stemming or lemmatization on the input text reduces the model's performance.
    This is because the model is able to generalize well and gets extra information out
    of the form the words are in.
  - Cleaning the data however improves the model's performance.
  - Financial model will predict 'neutral' very often so the accuracy here is low!
  - Fastest model is from LiYuan, most accurate model from nlptown.
  - The model with the best tradeoffs is from distilbert.
