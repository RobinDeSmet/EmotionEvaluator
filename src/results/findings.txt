FINDINGS
  - Applying stemming or lemmatization from nltk on the input text reduces the model's performance.
    This is because the model is able to generalize better with its own tokenizer.
  - Cleaning the data however can improve the model's performance.
  - Financial model will predict 'neutral' very often so the accuracy here is low!
  - Fastest model is from LiYuan
  - Most accurate model from NLPtown.
  - The model with the best tradeoffs is from Distilbert.
